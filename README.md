# Creating an AI Voice Bot with Custom Voice

## Introduction

This document outlines the steps to create an AI voice bot that converts text input into audio output using a friend's voice. This project involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, and deployment. The goal is to achieve a natural and accurate replication of your friend's voice.

## Step 1: Data Collection

### Obtain Consent

- **Ensure Permission:** Obtain explicit permission from your friend to use their voice data for this project.

### Record Voice Samples

- **Equipment:** Use a high-quality microphone in a quiet environment.
- **Content:** Record at least 1-2 hours of varied and clear speech to capture a wide range of phonetic contexts.

### Transcribe the Audio

- **Manual Transcription:** Transcribe the audio manually for accuracy.
- **Speech-to-Text Tools:** Optionally, use speech-to-text services to assist with the transcription.

## Step 2: Preprocessing the Data

### Segment the Audio

- **Tools:** Use tools like Praat to mark the start and end of each sentence or phrase.
- **Segmentation:** Save each segment as a separate audio file.

### Normalize the Audio

- **Libraries:** Use Python libraries such as `pydub` or `librosa` to normalize the audio files.

## Step 3: Model Selection and Training

### Choose a TTS Model

- **Popular Choices:**
  - **Tacotron 2**: Synthesizes natural-sounding speech.
  - **WaveGlow** or **WaveNet**: Converts the synthesized speech into waveform audio.

### Prepare the Training Environment

- **Setup:** Use a machine with a GPU for faster training. Install necessary libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### Train the TTS Model

- **Download Models:** Obtain Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow from NVIDIA’s GitHub repositories.
- **Organize Dataset:** Ensure the audio and transcription files are in the required format.

## Step 4: Fine-Tuning and Testing

### Fine-Tune the Model

- **Adjustments:** Modify hyperparameters and continue training based on initial results to improve accuracy.

### Generate Sample Outputs

- **Testing:** Provide text inputs to the trained model and generate audio outputs. Evaluate the quality and make necessary adjustments.

## Step 5: Deployment

### Develop Interface

- **Web Interface:** Create a simple web application using Flask to input text and get audio output.

### Integrate Model

- **Load and Use Model:** Load the trained model and generate audio responses in the endpoint.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**

  - **Audacity:** For recording and editing audio.
  - **Praat:** For audio segmentation.
  - **Python Libraries:** `pydub`, `librosa`.

- **Model Training:**

  - **Frameworks:** TensorFlow or PyTorch.
  - **Models:** NVIDIA’s Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow implementations.

- **Deployment:**
  - **Web Applications:** Flask or Django.
  - **Desktop Applications:** PyInstaller or Electron.

## Conclusion

Following these steps will enable you to create a custom AI voice bot that accurately replicates your friend's voice. The process involves detailed technical steps, leveraging your engineering expertise to handle the complexities of data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
